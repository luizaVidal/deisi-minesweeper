# deisi-minesweeper

This project was done in the first semester of college, in the Programming Fundamentals course. 
The code was developed in Kotlin language. 
The goal was to re-create the Minesweeper game, and with the instructions of our teachers, my groupmate and I were able to complete this challenge with great success!
